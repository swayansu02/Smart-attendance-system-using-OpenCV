# Smart-attendance-system-using-OpenCV
This project is aimed at developing a Smart Attendance System using OpenCV and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system captures images of people, trains a CNN model to recognize their faces, and then uses the trained model to mark attendance in real-time by recognizing the person's face from the webcam feed.
